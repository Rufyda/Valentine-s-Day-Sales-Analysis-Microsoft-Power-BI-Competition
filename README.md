# ❤️ Valentine's Day Sales Analysis – Microsoft Power BI Competition 💡📊

## 📌 Project Overview

I am excited to participate in the Microsoft Power BI competition! 🎉 

This project analyzes Valentine's Day sales data to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product popularity, and sales trends. Using Power BI, I have created an interactive and visually appealing report that highlights:

- 💰 **Total Sales Performance**
- 🛍️ **Top-Selling Products**
- 👥 **Customer Demographics & Buying Behavior**
- 🌍⏳ **Sales Trends by Location & Time of Day**
- 💳 **Popular Payment Methods**

Through this analysis, I aim to demonstrate the power of data visualization and how insights can drive better business decisions. 📈 I am thrilled to be part of this challenge and look forward to learning from other participants! 🤝
